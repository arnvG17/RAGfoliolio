### ✨ Overview
**RAGfolio** is my personal portfolio site built with React (frontend) and Node.js (backend).  
It features a **RAG chatbot originally trained on Lewis Hamilton content** but designed so you can easily swap in any data – just change the input file and redeploy.

---

### 🛠️ How It Works
1. Put your own text into `me.txt`.
2. Run `precompute.js` locally to generate `vectorStore.json` (parameters adjustable inside the file).
3. Copy the new `vectorStore.json` into the repo & redeploy.  
4. The chatbot instantly runs on your new content.
